## About
I successfully finished Bachelor's degree at CTU in Prague by defending this Bachelor thesis. 
It focuses on forensic analysis and the goal was to create tool for server log forensics.

In terms of programming languages, my code is a combination of Pearl and C++.

This is my seminar job that I created, when I was learning Architecture and Design Patterns in CTU Prague.

## Abstract
This thesis deals with the forensic analysis of server logs, how to connect
and utilize the data taken from these log files. The goal is to design a modular
tool that has the ability to create an overview of events within a defined
time interval. Correlations can be seen in the report. For example suspicious
activities such as unsuccessful login attempt and following repeated
attempts to authenticate from the same source address, etc. The tool can be
used to increase security and monitor events on the server. The application
is built in part on an existing solution that had been slightly improved for
the purpose of this work. The second part is the graphic superstructure
that I created in the Qt framework. It is a combination of C ++ and Perl
from the perspective of programming languages. The result of the work
is a functional application that is ready for further expansion. The server
administrator will easy manage to specify suspicious activities he wants to
track. The solution created successfully merges data from server logs and
performs forensic analysis.
